# SudokuSolvingApp
A Sudoku solving app that allows input to match a puzzle you may have on hand or solve from an empty grid, Created using js, html and css.

solver algorithm works fine, had fun with this one, took me a long while considering i still have not completed a physical sudoku puzzle in my life, built this because my partner is doing 2 sudoku puzzles a day and i wanted to be apart of the progression somehow.

text boxes are sanitized for integer inputs and single chars, in the future will add a you win view if solv btn is not used, and have it create games for playing by solving the puzzle then removing 80% of the digits.
